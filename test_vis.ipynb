Britain’s ability to meet its water needs is at a ‘critical point’, according to a report. It says water use should be drastically reduced and bills increased to penalise over consumption, as increasing temperatures and a rising population stretch resources. The Institute of Civil Engineers said the Government’s water strategy does not recognise the ‘urgency’ of the situation. Worrying: Britain's ability to meet its water needs is at a 'critical point', according to a report. This picture shows a low water level at Bewl Reservoir in Kent . They also said that hosepipe bans are not an effective long-term solution to the problem. In terms of ‘water security’ – our ability to meet the needs of homes and businesses regardless of the weather – the institute gave the UK a score of only four out of ten. On the scale one means constant drought and ten is perfect water security. They said the situation would only get worse without a national strategy to curb consumption by 30 per cent. Currently we use 150 litres (33 gallons) a day per person, but the report said we should aim for 105 litres (23 gallons). Recommendation: The report said universal water metering should be introduced to penalise non-essential use, such as car washing, as seen in this file picture . Among its recommendations, the report said universal water metering should be introduced to penalise non-essential use, such as car washing. They also suggested bringing in new technology to help water companies plug leaks. But the institute ruled out the construction of a ‘national water grid’ which could pipe water across the country from areas of high rainfall. They said such a system would be ‘extremely costly’ and would take many years to construct, by which time the situation would have worsened.\"],\n",

About 6.7 million people have now signed up for health coverage under the law since the 2013 rollout.

She said the term Obamacare \"has become very, very negative,\" but said individuals approve of the law\\'s policies to allow young people to say on their parents\\' plan until they turn 26 and approve of policies preventing insurers from denying coverage due to preexisting conditions. \"I\\'m not sure that we need to get people to love the act, they just need to understand what it\\'s about,\" she said. \"If they like the pieces of it, that\\'s fine.\" Sebelius had \\'toughest job in Washington\\'',\n",
       "  \"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 17:54 EST, 6 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 6 June 2012 . Britain’s ability to meet its water needs is at a ‘critical point’, according to a report. It says water use should be drastically reduced and bills increased to penalise over consumption, as increasing temperatures and a rising population stretch resources. The Institute of Civil Engineers said the Government’s water strategy does not recognise the ‘urgency’ of the situation. Worrying: Britain's ability to meet its water needs is at a 'critical point', according to a report. This picture shows a low water level at Bewl Reservoir in Kent . They also said that hosepipe bans are not an effective long-term solution to the problem. In terms of ‘water security’ – our ability to meet the needs of homes and businesses regardless of the weather – the institute gave the UK a score of only four out of ten. On the scale one means constant drought and ten is perfect water security. They said the situation would only get worse without a national strategy to curb consumption by 30 per cent. Currently we use 150 litres (33 gallons) a day per person, but the report said we should aim for 105 litres (23 gallons). Recommendation: The report said universal water metering should be introduced to penalise non-essential use, such as car washing, as seen in this file picture . Among its recommendations, the report said universal water metering should be introduced to penalise non-essential use, such as car washing. They also suggested bringing in new technology to help water companies plug leaks. But the institute ruled out the construction of a ‘national water grid’ which could pipe water across the country from areas of high rainfall. They said such a system would be ‘extremely costly’ and would take many years to construct, by which time the situation would have worsened.\"],\n",
